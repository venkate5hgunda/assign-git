A: Branches in Git help multiple Developers collaborate and work seamlessly as a team by providing isolated copies of code to each person while they're working on individual deliverables. A main branch (usually protected) also ensures that while new items are being worked upon, there's always a working/production-ready version of the code to fallback to, in case a change doesn't work out, or if some other developer wants to start working on a new feature, essentially acting like checkpoints for the code repository.
